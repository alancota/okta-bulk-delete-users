# Okta Preview: bulk deactivate and delete staged users
I came up with this script mostly to clean up preview tenants. At some point I had almost 12k users that I created from other tests and of course nobody got time to do it manually. So, Python to the rescue!

If you are like me and use the heck off of your tenant preview, this script might come in handy. I often have thousands and thousands of users after testing things and preparing some demo or POC. I'm just lazy and got no time to manually deleate one by one. This script does exactly that.

Before using it you are going to need an API token from your Okta preview. If you don't know how to get a token, please click here.
